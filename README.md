# gamechild
A new project based on a very old idea. A small, handheld, electronic game machine for kids, with a more politically correct name.

## Build System
This project uses 'bake' - https://github.com/jnider/bake
It's just a bash script, quite easy to install & use, and very effective.

## Hardware
Based on an STM32F103 that I found on Ali Express for $2. I'll post some pictures and design details on the wiki in the
future.
